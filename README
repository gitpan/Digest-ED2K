NAME
    Digest::ED2K - Perl implementation of the ED2k hash used in ED2K URIs

SYNOPSIS
     # Functional style
     use Digest::ED2K qw(ed2k ed2k_hex ed2k_base64);

     $hash = ed2k $data;
     $hash = ed2k_hex $data;
     $hash = ed2k_base64 $data;


     # OO style
     use Digest::ED2K;

     $ctx = Digest::ED2K->new;

     $ctx->add($data);
     $ctx->addfile(*FILE);

     $digest = $ctx->digest;
     $digest = $ctx->hexdigest;
     $digest = $ctx->b64digest;

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to use the ED2K hash algorithm from within Perl
    programs. It has the same interface as Digest.
